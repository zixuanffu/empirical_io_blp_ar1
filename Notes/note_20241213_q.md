# Questions

## Estimation 
1. Why do we want to impose an AR(1) structure on the unobserved product characteristics $\xi_{jt}$?
So that we do not need additional instruments (other product characteristics etc.) to estimate the $\gamma^L$.
2. $\rho^\xi$ and $\gamma^L$ are jointly estimated in the GMM. Or we estimate $\rho^\xi$ first (how) and then estimate $\gamma^L$ by linear regression?
This is done separately. 1) concentrate out 2) estimate jointly to get the correct variance and standard errors.

## Data
1. $\delta_{st}-\rho\delta_{s,t-1}$ should be observed. We need to have $\delta_{st}$ for every station and in every year, which is not the case in the car dataset. 
Simulate data and estimate?
