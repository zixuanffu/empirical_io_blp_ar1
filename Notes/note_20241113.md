# No assumption on the DGP of $\xi_{jt}$ 
After recovering ${\delta}_{jt}$ from the observed market share $s_{jt}$. We regress it on the product characteristics.

The **estimation equation** is
$$\delta_{jt}=x_{jt}\beta + p_{jt}\alpha+\xi_{jt}$$
where $x_j$ is the product characteristics, $p_j$ is the price, and $\xi_{jt}$ unobserved product characteristics. 

We can use the following moment conditions to estimate the parameters:
$$E(Z_{jt}'\xi_{jt})=0$$
where $Z_{jt}$ is the exogenous variable + instruments. 

The empirical moments condition is 
$$ \frac{1}{N}Z'\xi = 0$$ 
where $Z$ is $N \times J$ and $\xi$ is $N \times 1$.

# Impose AR(1) structure on $\xi_{jt}$
Now, we assume that $\xi_{jt}$ follows an AR(1) process:
$$\xi_{jt} = \rho \xi_{j,t-1} + \omega_{jt}$$
where $\omega_{jt}$ is the innovation term (error term) that is uncorrelated with $x_{jt}$ and $p_{jt}$.

The new **estimation equation** is
$$\delta_{jt} = x_{jt}\beta + p_{jt}\alpha + \rho \xi_{j,t-1} + \omega_{jt}$$
$$\rho \xi_{j,t-1} = \rho x_{j,t-1}\beta + \rho p_{j,t-1}\alpha + \rho\xi_{j,t-1}$$
$$\delta_{j,t}-\rho \delta_{j,t-1} = \beta x_{jt} - \rho\beta x_{j,t-1} + \alpha p_{jt} - \rho\alpha p_{j,t-1} + \omega_{jt} $$
Thus the parameters we want to estimate is $\beta$, $\alpha$, and $\rho$.
This corresponds exactly to the model in blundellbond2000. 

We rewrite as 
$$ \delta_{j,t} = \pi_1 x_{jt} + \pi_2 x_{j,t-1} + \pi_3 p_{jt} + \pi_4 p_{j,t-1} + \pi_5 \delta_{j,t-1} +\omega_{jt}$$ 
where $\omega_{jt} \sim \text{MA}(0)$.
The restriction that
$$\pi_4/\pi_3 = \pi_2/\pi_1 = -\pi_5$$
can be tested and imposed in the estimation.

Now we can perform standard GMM without any additional instruments because $\omega_{jt}$ is orthogonal to
$$ z_{jt} =[x_{jt}, x_{j,t-1}, p_{jt}, p_{j,t-1}, \delta_{j,t-1}]$$
